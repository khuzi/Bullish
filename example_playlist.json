            "description": "Align, the creator of the metal braces alternative Invisalign, is proving that paid and influencer advertising is kind of a big deal. For the last few years, $ALGN has doubled down on social media as a meaningful medium for advertising. In that same period of time, there has been a 25.6% year-over-year increase in teens using Invisalign. The stock skyrocketed nearly 35% today on news of the earnings.\n\nThe Gap is trimming fat. The retail giant and owner of Old Navy, Athleta, Banana Republic and its namesake retail store is planning to close stores and focus on e-commerce. The news has sent shares of $GPS 13% higher today. The shift in physical retail to online retail accelerated this year due to COVID-19 \u2014 something we have covered in a number of other stocks.\n\nOver the last few years, Snapchat\u2019s user growth has fallen off, even as ad revenues have started to make the company float. This is mainly due to the lack of presence outside of the U.S., TikTok and Facebook domination and the abysmal Android version of the app. However, for the first time in years, Snapchat managed to start growing again. The social media app posted their highest daily active user growth rate since 2017 and beat analyst expectations for Q3. Shares in $SNAP are up 37% since the earnings call.",

You could not find a better spokesperson than Josh when it comes to the ethos for this show. Josh has been collecting sneakers since he was 8 years old; it was the only thing he cared about. Now, he has turned his love for sneakers and a fun hobby into a billion-dollar business (and he\u2019s got the sneaker wall to prove it). \n\nStockX is the first of its kind. But, it\u2019s founded on a not-so-new concept \u2014 the stock market. Josh co-founded the Detroit-based company in 2016. StockX is a stock market for everything from sneakers to streetwear to collectables where customers participate in a live \u2018bid/ask\u2019 marketplace. Profits happen in seconds. \n\nJosh has an incredible product, company and story -- all of which Howard dives into on this episode. In this episode of Investing for Profit and Joy, Howard and Josh talk about the resale business, the regrowth of the collectables market, investing in everything from sneakers to Pok\u00e9mon cards, how he built his company from just a side project during his time at IBM, his tips for success and more.",

This is the biggest antitrust lawsuit since a case was filed against Microsoft in the late 90s. Because Google owns 90% of the search market share, they can charge a lot of money to advertisers. Google is also accused of paying Apple up to $12 billion a year to be the default search engine on Apple devices. This is a huge case that could completely alter how consumers use the internet.\n\nWhile other companies struggle to stay afloat in the midst of COVID-19, the video conferencing company Zoom continues to soar. After coming onto the scene in March when the world was on lockdown, Zoom offered a place to connect with friends, coworkers, students and more. In an effort to expand their product offering, diversify their income and combat \u201czoom fatigue,\u201d the company has created OnZoom, a platform to host paid online events.",

This is the biggest antitrust lawsuit since a case was filed against Microsoft in the late 90s. Because Google owns 90% of the search market share, they can charge a lot of money to advertisers. Google is also accused of paying Apple up to $12 billion a year to be the default search engine on Apple devices. This is a huge case that could completely alter how consumers use the internet.",

The most interesting thing to come from the event wasn't the new iPad Air or the Apple Watch SE: it was something that Apple only devoted like, two minutes to. Apple's introducing a new fitness program to compete with the likes of Peloton. Dumb Money fans know that Chris loves his $PTON \u2014 watch what happens live, as Chris, Dave, and Jordan react to Peloton stock (and $AAPL stock) swing up and down during the Apple event.",
